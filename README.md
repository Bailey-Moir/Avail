Finished this project. This is a discord bot I created for me and my friends, it is up 24/7 hosted locally, was great fun to code this. it was programmed using Node.js, Discord.js, and I didn't use any tutorials in terms of copy and pasting sort of stuff.

## Setup
```npm i```, change the 'token' in [config.json](config.json) to your bots token, add 'logs.txt' to the root, and run ```npm start``` to start the bot.
